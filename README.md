## Installation

### Using Composer

Flarum use Composer to manage its dependencies and extensions. The Serbian (Latin Script) language pack is available [on Packagist](https://packagist.org/packages/laravelrs/flarum-ext-serbian-latin) and can be managed that way. Make sure that [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) is installed on your machine, then run the following command in the location where Flarum is installed:

```
composer require laravelrs/flarum-ext-serbian-latin
```

The same command can be used to update independently the Serbian (Latin Script) language pack, without updating anything else. Note that because the Serbian (Latin Script) language pack will be added as a Flarum's dependency, it will also be automatically updated when updating Flarum and its dependencies via Composer.

### Manual Installation

1. Download [the latest stable release](https://github.com/laravelrs/flarum-ext-serbian-latin) (or [the latest development build](https://github.com/laravelrs/flarum-ext-serbian-latin/archive/master.zip)).
2. Unpack the downloaded archive with [a file archiver](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_file_archivers).
3. Log in to your server via [FTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_Transfer_Protocol), [SSH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell) or your provider's control panel.
4. Navigate to the *extensions/* directory of your Flarum installation.
5. Create a *laravelrs-serbian-latin/* subdirectory into it.
6. Upload all the content in the unpacked folder to this subdirectory.
